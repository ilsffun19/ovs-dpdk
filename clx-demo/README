Before you start running the scripts, you need to edit the following files:
start-ovs-dpdk.sh - edit the PCI ID devices which you will bind to DPDK, and other_config:dpdk-lcore-mask=0x200000 to the socket core which you want the ovs daemon to run on.

set_pmd_thread.sh  - edit the core mask for 6C12T depending on the socket cores you are running. You need to set the higher priority cores.

createports_pvp-6P-6c12t.sh - edit the PCI ID devices which you bind to DPDK and also the core affinity for each port

power_on_vm-vhost-user-6P.sh - set the correct taskset for the cores the VM will be running on.


./disable_service.sh
./stop_services.sh
cd /root/ovs-dpdk/vpp-vrouter-ovs
./start-ovs-dpdk.sh
./set_pmd_thread.sh
./createports_pvp-6P-6c12t.sh

cd 3vms
./power_on_vm-vhost-user-6P.sh
./addroutes_pvp-6P-vpp-ip.sh

to connect to the VM:
from your host, you can login to the VM via:
ssh -l root localhost -p 2023  (for VM1)

login to the VM and then run the following in the VM to start VPP:

./disable_service.sh
./stop_services.sh
./setup_huge.sh
systemctl start vpp
telnet localhost 5002

vpp# exec /root/vpp-vrouter/vpp-6p.conf

Do VM CPU pinning to the host for optimization

Setup traffic generator to arp to the VPP and then start traffic.
