to connect to the VM:
from your host, you can login to the VM via:
ssh -l root localhost -p 2023  (for VM1)
ssh -l root localhost -p 2024  (for VM2)
ssh -l root localhost -p 2025  (for VM3)

login to the VM and then run the following in the VM to start testpmd:

./disable_service.sh
./stop_services.sh
./setup_huge.sh
systemctl start vpp
telnet localhost 5002

vpp# exec /root/vpp-vrouter/vpp-2p.conf

Do VM CPU pinning to the host for optimization

Setup traffic generator to arp to the VPP and then start traffic.
